# chess_ai_reinforcementlearning
In this awesome repo, we're going to develop three different chess AI models to compare them! First, we'll play against ourselves using reinforcement learning. Then, we'll play against Stockfish. Finally, we'll use the database from the Kaggle competition to evaluate the positions.


# Deployment

Once we have the model trained it is important to deploy it properly, in order to do that we are going to use azure cloud.
